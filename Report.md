**INTRODUCTION:**
During my internship at NullCLass, I worked on a real-time project called **Twitter Analytics Dashboard using Power BI**. This internship gave me a *hands-on experience* in working with real-world datasets, DAX formulae, and creating insightful visualizations. It also helped me to practically apply the learnt lessons into a more practical, outcome-focused project. Through this report, Iâ€™ll be sharing my learning journey, the challenges I faced, the tasks I completed, and what I took away from the entire experience.

**BACKGROUND:**
Before starting this internship, I had completed the _*Twitter Analytics training*_ offered by NullClass. It covered the basics of working with raw data and using Power BI to analyze and visualize that data. We learnt how to clean and prepare data, write DAX formulas, and create dynamic dashboards. After completing the training, we were assigned internship tasks that had to be built on top of the existing dashboard created during training. These tasks were meant to push us further and help us apply our learning in a more advanced, real-world way.

**Learning Objectives:**
The main goal of this internship was to improve my _skills in data analysis and dashboard creation_ using Power BI. I wanted to get better at using DAX to handle complex logic, learn how to apply multiple filters to visuals, and make dashboards that are both interactive and dynamic. Through these tasks, I also hoped to get more comfortable solving real-world problems, thinking critically, and working independently without constant help or guidance.

**Activities and Tasks:**
During the internship, I worked on a real-time Twitter Analytics Dashboard using Power BI. First, I completed the training project, where I explored the dataset, created different visuals, and used DAX to calculate metrics like impressions, engagement rate, and likes. 
After that, I moved on to the internship tasks. Each task had specific requirements with multiple filters based on tweet content, time conditions, and interaction types. I created visuals like clustered bar charts and line charts using DAX measures and logical columns. The tasks pushed me to write detailed expressions in DAX and apply conditional filtering in the visuals.
Every step needed testing and troubleshooting to make sure the data matched the logic. Some conditions, like tweet word count above 40 or character filtering, needed extra calculations. I learned how to approach each task step-by-step and manage errors along the way.
